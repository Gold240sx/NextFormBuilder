# Form Builder

This is an app that allows me to create forms for various use cases quickly while retaining quality and flexibility.
This app is started with the formBuilder application built by this tutorial: https://youtu.be/QGXUUXy0AMw?si=rgR4XbKqE51bCQef.

This is by far one of the most challenging project I've worked on to date, requiring a lot of problem solving in order to get the app to behave with dependancy and framework differences. I've also made some
UI tweaks to the app I felt were appropriate.

## My own additions

A significant amount of changes have been made to the video's tutorial, including:

-   I have created direct code output of both the statically typed form variables as well as the dynamic variables of each component
-   I included Form Field Variations, to allow the mixture of not only types but styles and features of such.
